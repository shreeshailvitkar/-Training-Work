What is it
-------------------
A website where users can write short messages which are stored and published.

-------------------
Details
-------------------
Build a system where users can share "shouts" (posts) and images across the network, similar to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. It consists of two types of roles:
1. User
2. Admin

User:
1. Will need to register.
2. Can upload shouts as text, images, audio, videos.
3. Can accept/reject the invite of other users and make friends.
4. Only friends can see shouts.
5. Can remove any friend.
6. Can report any shouts.
7. Comments on the shouts (Optional).

The User facing application should be developed using Angular at frontend and REST APIs using Django framework at backend.

Admin:
1. Has to approve the registration request of users.
2. Can delete shouts of users.
3. Can delete users.
4. Can delete reports of shouts.

The Admin facing application should be purely developed using Django framework, without Angular.
